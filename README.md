# Conway's Game Of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton" target="_blank">cellular automaton</a> created by John Horton Conway in 1970. The game
consists of a 2D Grid in which each cell has two states - alive and dead. The state of each cell changes
from one generation to the next based on the following rules:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
- Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes live.

The neighbors of a cell are the 8 adjacent cell.
